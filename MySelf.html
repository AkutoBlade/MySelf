    <h1><b>About Me</b></h1> 
    <h3>Author Jared Isaacs</h3>
    <p>This is information pertaining on personal and endeavours.
    <br></br> 
    <br>As the creator of this website, I have the skills and abilities to edit the design. I'm a <b>Student</b> at Life Choices Academy for round about 2 weeks. 
        I love coding but another passion of mine is my poetry, it's way I express myself through symbolic phrases and meanings in life.
        Like coding I have this sense of passion everytime I solve a problem or scenario in code, both of my parents are not tech junkies so it's kind of difficult to relate to them to certain aspects.
        So you may asking yourself why I chose coding as another passion, the reason why want to make a name for myself in my family even though the we aren't a family of techno freaks </br>
